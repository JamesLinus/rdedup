# rdedup

`rdedup` is the data deduplication engine and backup software

`rdedup` is written in Rust and provides both command line tool
and library API (`rdedup-lib`).

`rdedup` is generally similar to existing software like
 duplicacy, restic, attic, duplicity, zbackup, etc.

 ## Features

 * support for public-key encryption (the only tool like that I'm aware of,
   and primary reason `rdedup` was created)
 * flat-file synchronization friendly (Dropbox, syncthing) backend
   * cloud backends are WIP
 * garbage collection
 * variety of supported algorithms:
   * chunking: bup, gear
   * hashing: blake2b, sha256
   * compression: deflate, xz2, bzip2, zstd, none
   * encryption: curve25519, none
   * easy abstraction
   * check `rdedup init --help` output for up-to-date list
 * extreme performance and parallelism - see [Rust fearless
   concurrency in `rdedup`](https://dpc.pw/blog/2017/04/rusts-fearless-concurrency-in-rdedup/)
 * attention to reliability (eg. `rdedup` is using `fsync` + `rename`
   to avoid data corruption even in case of hardware crash)

### Strong parts

It's written in Rust. It's a modern language, that is actually really nice to use.
Rust makes it easy to have a very robust and fast software.

The author is a nice person, welcomes contributions, and helps users. Or at
least he's trying... :)

### Shortcomings and missing features:

`rdedup` currently does not implement own backup/restore functionality (own
directory traversal), and because of that it's typically paired with `tar`
or `rdup` tools. Built-in directory traversal could improve deduplication
ratio for workloads with many small files.

Garbage collection could be optimized and made more scalable.

Cloud storage integrations are missing. The architecture to support it is
mostly implemented, but the actual backends are not.

### Installation

If you have `cargo` installed:

```rust
cargo install rdedup
```

If not, I highly recommend installing [rustup][rustup] (think `pip`, `npm` but for Rust)

[rustup]: https://www.rustup.rs/

In case of troubles, check
[rdedup building issues](https://github.com/dpc/rdedup/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3Abuilding)
or report a new one (sorry)!

### Usage

See `rdedup -h` for help.

Supported commands:

* `rdedup init` - create a *repo* directory with keypair used for encryption.
* `rdedup ls` - list all stored names.
* `rdedup store <name>` - store data read from standard input under given *name*.
* `rdedup load <name>` - load data stored under given *name* and write it on standard output
* `rdedup rm <name>` - remove the given *name*. This by itself does not remove the data.
* `rdedup gc` - remove any no longer reachable data

Check `rdedup init --help` for repository configuration options.

In combination with [rdup][rdup] this can be used to store and restore your backup like this:

```rust
rdup -x /dev/null "$HOME" | rdedup store home
rdedup load home | rdup-up "$HOME.restored"
```

`rdedup` is data agnostic, so formats like `tar`, `cpio` and other will work,
but to get benefits of deduplication, archive format should not be compressed
or encrypted already.
